Nestled on Vancouver Island - between Port Alberni and the popular coastal destinations of Ucluelet and Tofino, 5040 Peak presents a challenging ascent that leads to spectacular views and an immersive experience in the wild beauty of Vancouver Island. For those from or familiar with Vancouver, 5040 Peak has an incline comparable to the famed Grouse Grind, minus the well-maintained stairs. The rugged terrain is a mix of tree roots, exposed rocks, with sections that require navigating ropes, making it a true test of endurance and skill. 

# Preparing for the hike and camp
5040 Peak is a popular day hike destination, but to soak in all its beauty, we had opted to backpack up and camp overnight.

There are a couple of camping options, including at Cobalt Lake, at the 1350m ridge by the Hišimy̓awiƛ Hut, and at the 1450m ridge right before summiting the peak. The spots are first-come, first-serve and backcountry reservations are not required. Alternatively, if you would like a more modern experience, The Alpine Hut is reservable via the Alpine Club of Canada - Vancouver Island Section website: https://accvi.ca/5040-peak-hut/.

Days leading up to the hike, we used https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Klitsa-Mountain/forecasts/1000 (near 5040 Peak) to check the weather forecast. We strongly recommend utilizing this resource to adjust your hiking plans accordingly, even in hot summer days where you would think rain probability is low. Pacific Northwest weather is mysterious and that just means today could be hot and sunny, but the next day soaking wet.

Personal experience of how the weather forecast helped our planning:
We initially intended to camp 2 nights (Monday Jul 29th and Tuesday Jul 30th), and head down on Wednesday Jul 31. 
However, the weather forecast predicted rain for both Monday and Tuesday, with the cloud base expected to be lower than the peak, meaning we'd be shrouded in clouds throughout without views. Fortunately, the forecast indicated that the rain will stop and skies will begin to clear starting at midnight on Wednesday. 
In light of this, we’ve adjusted our plan: to brave the rain and hike up on Tuesday afternoon, camp, and make the most of the improved weather conditions on Wednesday before descending.

## Arriving at the trailhead
If you are not from the area and travelling like us, Ucluelet and Port Alberni are both close options to stay the night before. Both towns are ~ 1 hour away from the trailhead.

We stayed at Ucluelet and in the morning, enjoyed a coffee and breakfast at The Barkley Cafe https://thebarkleycafe.com/ before hitting the road. We also highly recommend The Break Cafe & Bistro https://www.instagram.com/thebreakcafebistro/?hl=en - their coffee and pastry options are amazing and just the comfort you'll need before a hike.

We followed Google Maps to get to the trailhead: https://maps.app.goo.gl/5mgYVMWjBvtqmzeT6. The map does end earlier than the actual trailhead, but once you're on the FSR, there's only one route and you won't miss it: just keep driving until you see vehicles parked and a small info board on the left indicating trailhead. 

The important thing is to follow Google Maps to turn onto the Marion Main Forest Service Road - it is quite a hidden pathway and easy to miss if you're driving fast and not actively following map instructions.
